                    EcoSnap is a personal assistant application designed to empower users to make environmentally conscious decisions. By leveraging emerging technologies such as Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, smart devices, and OpenAIâ€™s APIs, our application analyzes and determines the best course of action for consumers to reduce their carbon footprint. This involves suggesting sustainable alternatives in what they eat, buy, and consume. EcoSnap integrates real-time insights and actionable recommendations into everyday activities to foster sustainable habits, reduce individual carbon footprints, and promote a broader culture of environmental awareness and responsibility.

                    Our inspiration for this project stemmed from a desire to explore how we can lead more sustainable lifestyles without sacrificing convenience or time. Recognizing the importance of making environmentally conscious choices, we developed a tool that seamlessly integrates sustainability into daily decisions. By focusing on real-time insights and recommendations, we aim to simplify the process of choosing sustainable options that benefit both individuals and the environment. Utilizing emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and OpenAI's powerful language models, we analyze data to deliver personalized suggestions. Our goal is to empower users to embrace sustainability as a natural and convenient part of their everyday lives.

                    Working with Meta Smart glasses presented a unique challenge due to the lack of an SDK, necessitating the creation of a workaround. We tackled this by setting up a web server and implementing an API, which we then trained using a database. Initially, we experimented with different approaches, such as using Bun and a bookmarking web scraper. However, these solutions proved too unpredictable and inconsistent, leading us to refine our strategy for more reliable results.

                    During our project, we gained valuable insights into API integration, JavaScript, and Next.js, as well as the intricacies of both frontend and backend development. We discovered that documentation can be challenging, as it's often written for a specific programming language, requiring us to adapt it to our needs. This experience taught us the importance of creative problem-solving when faced with obstacles.

                    In hindsight, we realized that conducting more thorough research or choosing tools we were more familiar with could have streamlined our development process. Familiarity with the technologies used would have allowed us to anticipate potential challenges and navigate them more effectively. Additionally, reviewing documentation in advance would have provided us with a clearer understanding of the functionalities and limitations of the tools at our disposal, enabling us to make more informed decisions. This preparation could have saved us time and effort, allowing us to focus on innovation and problem-solving rather than troubleshooting unforeseen issues. Ultimately, this experience underscored the importance of preparation and knowledge when working with new technologies.

                    <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> The `/analyze` endpoint receives an uploaded image, converts it to a base64 format, and sends it to the OpenAI API for analysis. The response from the API is then parsed, and relevant information about the food item (such as calories, sustainability score, and alternatives) is extracted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Static File Serving:</strong> The server serves static files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, from the `public` directory. It also serves the processed JSON files generated by the API.</li>
                    <li><strong>Directory Management:</strong> The server ensures that necessary directories (`uploads`, `processed`, `public`) exist and creates them if they are missing.</li>
                    <li><strong>JSON Storage:</strong> Analysis results are saved in JSON format, both as individual files in the `processed` directory and in an `entries.json` file for aggregation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Listening Port:</strong> The server listens on port 3000 and provides a seamless interaction between the frontend and backend components of the application.</li>
