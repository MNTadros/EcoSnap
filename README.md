## What's EcoSnap?

EcoSnap was originally conceived as a first place winning hackathon project developed within a tight 48-hour timeframe. However, this version represents a complete rebuild that I have personally undertaken. Every line of code has been rewritten from scratch to ensure a robust and scalable foundation. Looking ahead, I plan to adapt EcoSnap into a fully functional phone application, bringing its features and benefits directly to users' fingertips for greater accessibility and impact.
## Purpose

EcoSnap helps users make eco-friendly choices by analyzing their actions and suggesting sustainable alternatives. It leverages technologies like smart devices and OpenAI APIs to provide real-time insights, fostering habits that reduce carbon footprints and promote environmental awareness.

## Inspiration

EcoSnap was inspired by the need for convenient tools to support sustainable living. By integrating AI and real-time data, it simplifies eco-conscious decisions, empowering users to adopt sustainability in their daily lives.

## What it does

**Eco-Friendly Food Companion:**
- **Food Item Analysis:** Scans and evaluates food items for their environmental impact, offering sustainability ratings.
- **Alternative Suggestions:** Recommends eco-friendly food alternatives tailored to dietary preferences.
- **Educational Insights:** Provides information on food miles, seasonal produce, and recipes with sustainable ingredients.

## How we built it

We used OpenAI API, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Machine Learning, Prompt Engineering to develop EcoSnap.
